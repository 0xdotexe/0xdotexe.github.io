      <description>The name&amp;rsquo;s Sarvagya Sagar . He is a tireless seeker of knowledge, occassional purveyor of wisdom and also, coincidentally, a hacker. He enjoys never being satisfied with his programming, traveling, bhojpuri songs &amp;amp; movies, teaching, burger, mathematics and occasionally sketching with touch of mellow smoothness. Stab forks into your eyeballs looking at his Twitter handler to take a closer look at his work history and whatnot. Technology should work for people, not the other way around.</description>
